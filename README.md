Basic Login OAuth form. Only Google OAuth in Added to Add Facebook append Facebook Strategy below Google's and define same paths as Google.  
Local login is not completed fully (Cause not asked in the Task 😁😁 but only OAuth doesn't looks good so did it anyway) it will bug out if you add empty data while logging in or registering.
